# TimerBolt-ReactNative
Refactor of an Ionic sample app providing user authentication, activity tracking, timer and chronometer functionality.
App structure uses React+Redux, Axios, NativeBase and a couple of third party components.
The app is meant to be used with a dummy API whose source code can be found in the TimerBolt-API project.

## Main features

### User authentication.

* Authentication token handling for users credentials.

### Time tracking.

* Standard pomodoro implementation with a counter for how many iterations have passed.
* Countdown timer, prompting users to store an activity after its completion .
* Chronometer.

### User activities log
* Activity history breakdown for user stored activities.

### Schedule
* Schedule containing a timeline view of the tasks to be performed on an specific date (can be changed to any date using a calendar prompt).
* Recurring/single use task insertion.
